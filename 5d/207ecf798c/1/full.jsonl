implementing → reviewing → done`\n\n**your work covers:** `(any state) → planning → ready`\n\n- kasmos sets the plan status to `planning` when it spawns you\n- you explore the design, write the plan doc, signal completion\n- kasmos picks it up and moves it to `implementing` when the user triggers execution\n- you do NOT implement, review, or merge — stop after signaling\n\n---\n\n## design exploration\n\nbefore writing a single task, understand what you're building. do NOT skip this phase even\nfor seemingly simple features. unexamined assumptions are where wasted work comes from.\n\n### step 1: explore project context\n\nread the codebase before asking questions:\n- check relevant source files, recent git log, existing docs\n- understand the current architecture and patterns in use\n- identify what already exists vs what needs building\n\n```bash\ngit log --oneline -20\nrg 'relevant_term' --type go -l\n```\n\n### step 2: ask clarifying questions — one at a time\n\nask questions sequentially. never batch multiple questions in one message.\n\nfocus on:\n- **purpose** — what problem does this solve? what's the success criterion?\n- **constraints** — performance, compatibility, existing interfaces to maintain?\n- **scope** — what's explicitly out of scope? what's intentionally deferred?\n- **edge cases** — what happens when X fails? when Y is missing?\n\nprefer multiple-choice questions when the answer space is bounded. open-ended is fine for\nopen-ended problems.\n\n**YAGNI ruthlessly.** if a feature won't be used in the next wave of work, cut it. simpler\nis always better until proven otherwise.\n\n### step 3: propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs\n\npresent options concisely. lead with your recommendation.\n\n```\n**approach A (recommended):** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**approach B:** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete

2–4 | review per wave |\n\n**sizing rules:**\n- every task = 15–45 minutes of cohesive work. < 10 min → merge into adjacent task.\n- never split tightly coupled work across tasks. if task B can't be tested without task A's output, combine them.\n- a task is a commit-worthy unit — leaves the codebase compilable and testable.\n- waves exist for dependency ordering, not grouping. if all tasks are independent, flat list under `## Wave 1`.\n- one-line changes, dead code removal, and config updates are NOT standalone tasks — bundle into the task they serve.\n\n### wave structure\n\n**every plan

structural checks\n\n- [ ] **wave headers present** — at least one `## Wave 1` header exists. plans without\n  wave headers cannot be executed by kasmos.\n- [ ] **task headers present** — every wave contains at least one `### Task N: Title` entry.\n- [ ] **task numbering sequential** — task numbers are sequential across the entire plan\n  (Task 1, Task 2, ..., not restarting per wave).\n- [ ] **required header fields** — plan starts with `**Goal:**`, `**Architecture:**`,\n  `**Tech Stack:**`, and `**Size:**` fields. all four must be present and non-empty.\n- [ ] **wave dependencies justified** — if wave N > 1 exists, it has a\n  `> **depends on wave N-1:**` line explaining the dependency. if all tasks are\n  independent, they should be in a single wave.\n\n### task quality checks\n\n- [ ] **files listed** — every task has a `**Files:**` block listing create/modify/test paths.\n  paths must be exact (no placeholders like `path/to/...`).\n- [ ] **TDD steps present** — every task has Step 1 (write failing test), Step 2 (run test,\n  expect fail), Step 3 (implement), Step 4 (run test, expect pass), Step 5 (commit).\n  trivial tasks (config-only, no testable logic) may omit Steps 1-2 but must note why.\n- [ ] **test commands runnable** — `go test` commands reference real package paths that will\n  exist after the task's files are created. no `./path/to/package/...` placeholders.\n- [ ] **commit messages present** — every task ends with a concrete `git commit -m \"...\"` step.\n- [ ] **no micro-tasks** — no task is < 10 minutes of work. if one is, merge it into an\n  adjacent task.\n- [ ] **no mega-tasks** — no task is > 45 minutes. if one is, split it.\n\n### coherence checks\n\n- [ ] **goal alignment** — re-read the `**Goal:**` field. does every task contribute to it?\n  flag any task that doesn't.\n- [ ] **no scope creep** — no task introduces work beyond what the goal describes. if you\n  find yourself adding \"while we're at it\" tasks, remove them.\n- [ ] **dependency ordering** — tasks in wave N do not depend on outputs from tasks in the\n  same wave (those should be in separate waves). tasks within a wave must be independently\n  implementable.\n- [ ] **file conflict check** — no two tasks in the same wave modify the same file. if they\n  do, either merge the tasks or move one to a later wave.\n\n### review outcome\n\nif all checks pass: proceed to commit + signal.\n\nif any check fails: fix the plan file inline, then re-run the failed checks. do not\nproceed until all checks pass. common fixes:\n- missing wave headers → wrap all tasks under `## Wave 1`\n- missing TDD steps → add the 5-step structure to each task\n- vague file paths → look up actual paths with `fd` or `rg`\n- micro-task → merge into adjacent task, renumber\n- file conflicts in same wave → reorder into separate waves\n\n### 1. create todos\n\ncall `TodoWrite` with one entry per `### Task N:` in the plan, all

implementing → reviewing → done`\n\n**your work covers:** `(any state) → planning → ready`\n\n- kasmos sets the plan status to `planning` when it spawns you\n- you explore the design, write the plan doc, signal completion\n- kasmos picks it up and moves it to `implementing` when the user triggers execution\n- you do NOT implement, review, or merge — stop after signaling\n\n---\n\n## design exploration\n\nbefore writing a single task, understand what you're building. do NOT skip this phase even\nfor seemingly simple features. unexamined assumptions are where wasted work comes from.\n\n### step 1: explore project context\n\nread the codebase before asking questions:\n- check relevant source files, recent git log, existing docs\n- understand the current architecture and patterns in use\n- identify what already exists vs what needs building\n\n```bash\ngit log --oneline -20\nrg 'relevant_term' --type go -l\n```\n\n### step 2: ask clarifying questions — one at a time\n\nask questions sequentially. never batch multiple questions in one message.\n\nfocus on:\n- **purpose** — what problem does this solve? what's the success criterion?\n- **constraints** — performance, compatibility, existing interfaces to maintain?\n- **scope** — what's explicitly out of scope? what's intentionally deferred?\n- **edge cases** — what happens when X fails? when Y is missing?\n\nprefer multiple-choice questions when the answer space is bounded. open-ended is fine for\nopen-ended problems.\n\n**YAGNI ruthlessly.** if a feature won't be used in the next wave of work, cut it. simpler\nis always better until proven otherwise.\n\n### step 3: propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs\n\npresent options concisely. lead with your recommendation.\n\n```\n**approach A (recommended):** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**approach B:** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**approach C:** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**recommendation:** A, because [specific reasoning for this codebase/context].\n```\n\nget explicit approval before writing the plan. if the user redirects to a different\napproach, update your recommendation and confirm before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## plan document format\n\n**save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n### required header\n\nevery plan MUST start with this header block:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n**Goal:** [one sentence describing what this builds and why]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences describing the approach — key files, patterns, data flow]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [key technologies, libraries, or internal packages involved]\n\n**Size:** [Trivial/Small/Medium/Large] (estimated ~[time], [N] tasks, [N] waves)\n\n---\n```\n\n### sizing table\n\nclassify before writing any tasks. this determines wave structure and review overhead.\n\n| size | estimated effort | max tasks | waves | review model |\n|------|-----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|\n| **trivial** | < 30 min | 1 | 1 | self-review only |\n| **small** | 30 min – 2 hours | 2–3 | 1 | single review after all tasks |\n| **medium** | 2–6 hours | 3–6 | 1–2 | review per wave |\n| **large** | 6+ hours | 6–12 | 2–4 | review per wave |\n\n**sizing rules:**\n- every task = 15–45 minutes of cohesive work. < 10 min → merge into adjacent task.\n- never split tightly coupled work across tasks. if task B can't be tested without task A's output, combine them.\n- a task is a commit-worthy unit — leaves the codebase compilable and testable.\n- waves exist for dependency ordering, not grouping. if all tasks are independent, flat list under `## Wave 1`.\n- one-line changes, dead code removal, and config updates are NOT standalone tasks — bundle into the task they serve.\n\n### wave structure\n\n**every plan must have at least `## Wave 1`.** kasmos uses wave headers for orchestration.\na plan without any `## Wave N` header cannot be executed by kasmos.\n\n```markdown\n## Wave 1: [Subsystem Name]\n\n[optional: 1-sentence description of what this wave delivers]\n\n### Task 1: [Component Name]\n...\n\n### Task 2: [Component Name]\n...\n```\n\n**wave N > 1 must justify the boundary:**\n\n```markdown\n## Wave 2: [Subsystem Name]\n\n> **depends on wave 1:** [specific reason — what output from wave 1 is required here]\n```\n\n**when NOT to use multiple waves:**\n- all tasks are independent → single `## Wave 1`\n- feature is small (< 3 tasks)\n- the \"dependency\" is just imports (the compiler catches that)\n\n### task structure\n\neach task follows TDD steps. be specific — exact file paths, exact commands, concrete code.\n\n````markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/new-file.go`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.go`\n- Test: `exact/path/to/file_test.go`\n\n**Step 1: write the failing test**\n\n```go\nfunc TestSpecificBehavior(t *testing.T) {\n    result := FunctionUnderTest(input)\n    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: run test to verify it fails**\n\n```bash\ngo test ./path/to/package/... -run TestSpecificBehavior -v\n```\n\nexpected: FAIL — `FunctionUnderTest undefined` or similar\n\n**Step 3: write minimal implementation**\n\n[concrete implementation — not \"add validation\", but actual code or precise description]\n\n**Step 4: run test to verify it passes**\n\n```bash\ngo test ./path/to/package/... -run TestSpecificBehavior -v\n```\n\nexpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add exact/path/to/new-file.go exact/path/to/file_test.go\ngit commit -m \"feat: [what this task delivers]\"\n```\n````\n\n**granularity anti-patterns — do NOT create tasks like these:**\n- \"add one case to a switch statement\" — merge into the task that needs it\n- \"remove dead code\" — do it in the task that replaces it\n- \"update help text\" — do it in the task that adds the feature\n- \"run the full test suite\" — that's a step, not a task\n\n---\n\n## after writing the plan\n\ndo all of these immediately after saving the plan file. do not skip any.\n\n### 1. create todos\n\ncall `TodoWrite` with one entry per `### Task N:` in the plan, all `pending`:\n\n```\nTodoWrite([\n  { content: \"Task 1: [Component Name]\", status: \"pending\", priority: \"high\" },\n  { content: \"Task 2: [Component Name]\", status: \"pending\", priority: \"high\" },\n  ...\n])\n```\n\n### 2. commit the plan\n\n```bash\ngit add docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\ngit commit -m \"plan: <feature name>\"\n```\n\ndo NOT commit sentinel files — kasmos consumes and deletes them automatically.\n\n---\n\n## signaling\n\ncheck your execution context:\n\n```bash\necho \"${KASMOS_MANAGED:-}\"\n```\n\n### managed mode (`KASMOS_MANAGED=1`)\n\nkasmos is orchestrating this session. write a sentinel file and stop.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/plans/.signals\ntouch docs/plans/.signals/planner-finished-YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\n```\n\nthe filename must match the plan filename exactly (with `planner-finished-` prefix).\n\n**do NOT edit `plan-state.json` directly** — kasmos manages that file.\n\nannounce completion and stop:\n\n> \"plan complete. saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`. kasmos will prompt you to start implementation.\"\n\n**stop here. do not offer execution choices. do not implement.**\n\n### manual mode (`KASMOS_MANAGED` unset)\n\nregister the plan in `plan-state.json`. read the file first, then add:\n\n```json\n\"YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\": { \"status\": \"ready\" }\n```\n\ncommit:\n\n```bash\ngit add docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md docs/plans/plan-state.json\ngit commit -m

feature.\"\n\n<HARD-GATE>\n## banned tools\n\nthese legacy tools are NEVER permitted. using them is a violation, not a preference.\n\n| banned | replacement | no exceptions |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|\n| `grep` | `rg` (ripgrep) | even for simple one-liners. `rg` is faster, respects .gitignore, and handles encoding correctly |\n| `grep -r` | `rg` | recursive grep is still grep. always `rg` |\n| `grep -E` | `rg` | extended regex is still grep. `rg` supports the same patterns |\n| `sed` | `sd` | even for one-liners. `sd` has saner syntax and no delimiter escaping |\n| `awk` | `yq`/`jq` (structured) or `sd` (text) | no awk for any purpose |\n| `find` | `fd` or glob tools | even for simple file listing. `fd` respects .gitignore; use `fd -e go` for extension |\n| `diff` (standalone) | `difft` | `git diff` is fine — standalone `diff` is not |\n| `wc -l` | `scc` | even for single files |\n\n**`git diff` is allowed** — it's a git subcommand, not standalone `diff`. use `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff` when reviewing code changes.\n\n**STOP.** if you are about to type `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `find`, `diff`, or `wc` — stop and use the replacement. there are no exceptions. \"just this once\" is a violation.\n\n## tool selection by task\n\n| task | use | not | why |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| rename symbol across files | `ast-grep` | `sed`/`sd` | ast-aware, won't rename inside strings/comments |\n| structural code rewrite | `comby` | `sed`/`awk` | understands balanced delimiters, nesting |\n| find code pattern | `ast-grep --pattern` | `grep`/`rg` | matches syntax, not text |\n| find literal string | `rg` | `grep` | fast, respects .gitignore, correct encoding |\n| find files by name/extension | `fd` | `find` | respects .gitignore, simpler syntax |\n| replace string in files | `sd` | `sed` | no delimiter escaping, sane defaults |\n| read/modify YAML/TOML/JSON | `yq` / `jq` | `sed`/`awk` | understands structure, preserves formatting |\n| review code changes | `difft` | `diff` | syntax-aware, ignores formatting noise |\n| spell check code | `typos` | manual | understands camelCase, identifiers |\n| count lines / codebase metrics | `scc` | `wc -l`/`cloc` | fast, includes complexity estimates |\n\n## violations\n\n| violation | required fix |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| using `grep` for anything | use `rg` for text search, `ast-grep` for code patterns |\n| using `sed` for anything | use `sd` for replacements, `ast-grep`/`comby` for refactoring |\n| using `awk` for anything | use `yq`/`jq` for structured data, `sd` for text processing |\n| using `find` for anything | use `fd` for file finding, glob tools for path patterns |\n| using standalone `diff` | use `difft` for syntax-aware structural diffs |\n| using `wc -l` for counting | use `scc` for language-aware counts + complexity |\n| splitting `{` / `}` in comby templates | always inline: `{:[body]}` not `{\\n:[body]\\n}` |\n| forgetting `-in-place` with comby | without it, comby only previews changes |\n</HARD-GATE>\n\n---\n\n## where you fit\n\nthe plan lifecycle FSM: `ready → planning → implementing → reviewing → done`\n\n**your work covers:** `(any state) → planning → ready`\n\n- kasmos sets the plan status to `planning` when it spawns you\n- you explore the design, write the plan doc, signal completion\n- kasmos picks it up and moves it to `implementing` when the user triggers execution\n- you do NOT implement, review, or merge — stop after signaling\n\n---\n\n## design exploration\n\nbefore writing a single task, understand what you're building. do NOT skip this phase even\nfor seemingly simple features. unexamined assumptions are where wasted work comes from.\n\n### step 1: explore project context\n\nread the codebase before asking questions:\n- check relevant source files, recent git log, existing docs\n- understand the current architecture and patterns in use\n- identify what already exists vs what needs building\n\n```bash\ngit log --oneline -20\nrg 'relevant_term' --type go -l\n```\n\n### step 2: ask clarifying questions — one at a time\n\nask questions sequentially. never batch multiple questions in one message.\n\nfocus on:\n- **purpose** — what problem does this solve? what's the success criterion?\n- **constraints** — performance, compatibility, existing interfaces to maintain?\n- **scope** — what's explicitly out of scope? what's intentionally deferred?\n- **edge cases** — what happens when X fails? when Y is missing?\n\nprefer multiple-choice questions when the answer space is bounded. open-ended is fine for\nopen-ended problems.\n\n**YAGNI ruthlessly.** if a feature won't be used in the next wave of work, cut it. simpler\nis always better until proven otherwise.\n\n### step 3: propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs\n\npresent options concisely. lead with your recommendation.\n\n```\n**approach A (recommended):** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**approach B:** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**approach C:** [brief description]\n- pro: [concrete advantage]\n- con: [concrete disadvantage]\n\n**recommendation:** A, because [specific reasoning for this codebase/context].\n```\n\nget explicit approval before writing the plan. if the user redirects to a different\napproach, update your recommendation and confirm before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## plan document format\n\n**save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n### required header\n\nevery plan MUST start with this header block:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n**Goal:** [one sentence describing what this builds and why]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences describing the approach — key files, patterns, data flow]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [key technologies, libraries, or internal packages involved]\n\n**Size:** [Trivial/Small/Medium/Large] (estimated ~[time], [N] tasks, [N] waves)\n\n---\n```\n\n### sizing table\n\nclassify before writing any tasks. this determines wave structure and review overhead.\n\n| size | estimated effort | max tasks | waves | review model |\n|------|-----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|\n| **trivial** | < 30 min | 1 | 1 | self-review only |\n| **small** | 30 min – 2 hours | 2–3 | 1 | single review after all tasks |\n| **medium** | 2–6 hours | 3–6 | 1–2 | review per wave |\n| **large** | 6+ hours | 6–12 | 2–4 | review per wave |\n\n**sizing rules:**\n- every task = 15–45 minutes of cohesive work. < 10 min → merge into adjacent task.\n- never split tightly coupled work across tasks. if task B can't be tested without task A's output, combine them.\n- a task is a commit-worthy unit — leaves the codebase compilable and testable.\n- waves exist for dependency ordering, not grouping. if all tasks are independent, flat list under `## Wave 1`.\n- one-line changes, dead code removal, and config updates are NOT standalone tasks — bundle into the task they serve.\n\n### wave structure\n\n**every plan must have at least `## Wave 1`.** kasmos uses wave headers for orchestration.\na plan without any `## Wave N` header cannot be executed by kasmos.\n\n```markdown\n## Wave 1: [Subsystem Name]\n\n[optional: 1-sentence description of what this wave delivers]\n\n### Task 1: [Component Name]\n...\n\n### Task 2: [Component Name]\n...\n```\n\n**wave N > 1 must justify the boundary:**\n\n```markdown\n## Wave 2: [Subsystem Name]\n\n> **depends on wave 1:** [specific reason — what output from wave 1 is required here]\n```\n\n**when NOT to use multiple waves:**\n- all tasks are independent → single `## Wave 1`\n- feature is small (< 3 tasks)\n- the \"dependency\" is just imports (the compiler catches that)\n\n### task structure\n\neach task follows TDD steps. be specific — exact file paths, exact commands, concrete code.\n\n````markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/new-file.go`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.go`\n- Test: `exact/path/to/file_test.go`\n\n**Step 1: write the failing test**\n\n```go\nfunc TestSpecificBehavior(t *testing.T) {\n    result := FunctionUnderTest(input)\n    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: run test to verify it fails**\n\n```bash\ngo test ./path/to/package/... -run TestSpecificBehavior -v\n```\n\nexpected: FAIL — `FunctionUnderTest undefined` or similar\n\n**Step 3: write minimal implementation**\n\n[concrete implementation — not \"add validation\", but actual code or precise description]\n\n**Step 4: run test to verify it passes**\n\n```bash\ngo test ./path/to/package/... -run TestSpecificBehavior -v\n```\n\nexpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add exact/path/to/new-file.go exact/path/to/file_test.go\ngit commit -m \"feat: [what this task delivers]\"\n```\n````\n\n**granularity anti-patterns — do NOT create tasks like these:**\n- \"add one case to a switch statement\" — merge into the task that needs it\n- \"remove dead code\" — do it in the task that replaces it\n- \"update help text\" — do it in the task that adds the feature\n- \"run the full test suite\" — that's a step, not a task\n\n---\n\n## after writing the plan\n\ndo all of these immediately after saving the plan file. do not skip any.\n\n## plan review\n\nafter writing the plan file, review it against this checklist before committing.\nthis is mandatory — do not skip it, even for trivial plans. fix every failure\ninline (edit the plan file directly) before proceeding to commit + signal.\n\n### structural checks\n\n- [ ] **wave headers present** — at least one `## Wave 1` header exists. plans without\n  wave headers cannot be executed by kasmos.\n- [ ] **task headers present** — every wave contains at least one `### Task N: Title` entry.\n- [ ] **task numbering sequential** — task numbers are sequential across the entire plan\n  (Task 1, Task 2, ..., not restarting per wave).\n- [ ] **required header fields** — plan starts with `**Goal:**`, `**Architecture:**`,\n  `**Tech Stack:**`, and `**Size:**` fields. all four must be present and non-empty.\n- [ ] **wave dependencies justified** — if wave N > 1 exists, it has a\n  `> **depends on wave N-1:**` line explaining the dependency. if all tasks are\n  independent, they should be in a single wave.\n\n### task quality checks\n\n- [ ] **files listed** — every task has a `**Files:**` block listing create/modify/test paths.\n  paths must be exact (no placeholders like `path/to/...`).\n- [ ] **TDD steps present** — every task has Step 1 (write failing test), Step 2 (run test,\n  expect fail), Step 3 (implement), Step 4 (run test, expect pass), Step 5 (commit).\n  trivial tasks (config-only, no testable logic) may omit Steps 1-2 but must note why.\n- [ ] **test commands runnable** — `go test` commands reference real package paths that will\n  exist after the task's files are created. no `./path/to/package/...` placeholders.\n- [ ] **commit messages present** — every task ends with a concrete `git commit -m \"...\"` step.\n- [ ] **no micro-tasks** — no task is < 10 minutes of work. if one is, merge it into an\n  adjacent task.\n- [ ] **no mega-tasks** — no task is > 45 minutes. if one is, split it.\n\n### coherence checks\n\n- [ ] **goal alignment** — re-read the `**Goal:**` field. does every task contribute to it?\n  flag any task that doesn't.\n- [ ] **no scope creep** — no task introduces work beyond what the goal describes. if you\n  find yourself adding \"while we're at it\" tasks, remove them.\n- [ ] **dependency ordering** — tasks in wave N do not depend on outputs from tasks in the\n  same wave (those should be in separate waves). tasks within a wave must be independently\n  implementable.\n- [ ] **file conflict check** — no two tasks in the same wave modify the same file. if they\n  do, either merge the tasks or move one to a later wave.\n\n### review outcome\n\nif all checks pass: proceed to commit + signal.\n\nif any check fails: fix the plan file inline, then re-run the failed checks. do not\nproceed until all checks pass. common fixes:\n- missing wave headers → wrap all tasks under `## Wave 1`\n- missing TDD steps → add the 5-step structure to each task\n- vague file paths → look up actual paths with `fd` or `rg`\n- micro-task → merge into adjacent task, renumber\n- file conflicts in same wave → reorder into separate waves\n\n### 1. create todos\n\ncall `TodoWrite` with one entry per `### Task N:` in the plan, all `pending`:\n\n```\nTodoWrite([\n  { content: \"Task 1: [Component Name]\", status: \"pending\", priority: \"high\" },\n  { content: \"Task 2: [Component Name]\", status: \"pending\", priority: \"high\" },\n  ...\n])\n```\n\n### 2. commit the plan\n\n```bash\ngit add docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\ngit commit -m \"plan: <feature name>\"\n```\n\ndo NOT commit sentinel files — kasmos consumes and deletes them automatically.\n\n---\n\n## signaling\n\ncheck your execution context:\n\n```bash\necho \"${KASMOS_MANAGED:-}\"\n```\n\n### managed mode (`KASMOS_MANAGED=1`)\n\nkasmos is orchestrating this session. write a sentinel file and stop.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/plans/.signals\ntouch docs/plans/.signals/planner-finished-YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\n```\n\nthe filename must match the plan filename exactly (with `planner-finished-` prefix).\n\n**do NOT edit `plan-state.json` directly** — kasmos manages that file.\n\nannounce completion and stop:\n\n> \"plan complete. saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`. kasmos will prompt you to start implementation.\"\n\n**stop here. do not offer execution choices. do not implement.**\n\n### manual mode (`KASMOS_MANAGED` unset)\n\nregister the plan in `plan-state.json`. read the file first, then add:\n\n```json\n\"YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\": { \"status\": \"ready\" }\n```\n\ncommit:\n\n```bash\ngit add docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md docs/plans/plan-state.json\ngit commit -m \"plan: <feature name>\"\n```\n\nthen offer execution choices:\n\n> \"plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`. two execution options:\n>\n> **1. this session** — i dispatch a fresh subagent per task, self-review between waves.\n>\n> **2. new session** — open a new session in this worktree, load the `kasmos-coder` skill, execute the plan task-by-task.\n>\n> which approach?\"\n\nif option 1: execute tasks sequentially in this session using TDD discipline from `kasmos-coder`.\nif option 2: stop and let the user open a new session.\n",

Your job is to audit the implementation branch against the plan, enforce\nquality standards, and either approve or request changes. You do not implement features.\n\n## CLI Tools Hard Gate\n\n<HARD-GATE>\n### Banned Tools\n\nThese legacy tools are NEVER permitted. Using them is a violation, not a preference.\n\n| Banned | Replacement | No Exceptions |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|\n| `grep` | `rg` (ripgrep) | Even for simple one-liners |\n| `grep -r` | `rg` | Recursive grep is still grep |\n| `find` | `fd` or glob tools | Even for simple file listing |\n| `sed` | `sd` | Even for one-liners |\n| `awk` | `yq`/`jq` (structured) or `sd` (text) | No awk for any purpose |\n| `diff` (standalone) | `difft` | `git diff` is fine — standalone `diff` is not |\n| `wc -l` | `scc` | Even for single files |\n\n**`git diff` is allowed** — it is a git subcommand, not standalone `diff`. Use\n`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff` when reviewing code changes.\n\n**STOP.** If you are about to type `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `find`, `diff`, or `wc` — stop and\nuse the replacement. There are no exceptions.\n</HARD-GATE>\n\n### Tool Selection\n\n| Task | Use | Not |\n|------|-----|-----|\n| Find code pattern | `ast-grep --pattern` | `grep`/`rg` |\n| Find literal string | `rg` | `grep` |\n| Find files by name/extension | `fd` | `find` |\n| Replace string in files | `sd` | `sed` |\n| Review code changes | `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff` | standalone `diff` |\n| Spell check code | `typos` | manual |\n| Count lines / codebase metrics | `scc` | `wc -l` |\n\n## Where You Fit\n\nYou review the implementation branch **after coders finish**. Your scope is the diff between\nthe base branch and HEAD — nothing more.\n\n```bash\n# See all changes since branching from main\nGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff main..HEAD\n\n# Or by file for targeted review\nGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff main..HEAD -- path/to/file.go\n```\n\nIn **managed mode** (`KASMOS_MANAGED=1`): kasmos spawned you after receiving the\n`coder-finished-<planfile>` sentinel. Review, signal outcome, and stop. Do not merge,\npush, or create PRs — kasmos handles post-approval actions.\n\nIn **manual mode** (unset): you were invoked directly or self-dispatched. After signaling,\nadditionally offer merge/PR/keep/discard options (see Signal Format section).\n\n## Review Checklist\n\nWork through these in order. Cite `file:line` for every finding.\n\n### Spec Compliance\n\n- [ ] All tasks in the plan are present and complete — check each `### Task N:` entry\n- [ ] No scope creep — changes are confined to what the plan describes\n- [ ] Task requirements met — not just \"something was written\" but the _right_ thing\n- [ ] Wave structure respected — tasks from later waves don't depend on earlier unfinished work\n- [ ] Plan goal achieved — step back and verify the top-level `Goal:` is satisfied\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- [ ] Error handling — errors returned, not silently dropped; no bare `panic` in library code\n- [ ] DRY — no copy-paste logic that should be shared; helper functions extracted where useful\n- [ ] Edge cases — nil inputs, empty slices, zero values, concurrent access if applicable\n- [ ] Test coverage — new logic has tests; tests actually exercise the code, not just call it\n- [ ] Test quality — table-driven where appropriate, no test helpers that hide assertions\n- [ ] Production readiness — no debug prints, no TODO comments left in critical paths\n- [ ] Naming — exported names are clear, unexported names are concise; no abbreviation soup\n- [ ] Imports — no unused imports, no import cycles introduced\n- [ ] Documentation — exported types and functions have doc comments\n\n### Running Tests\n\nRun the full test suite before approving. Do not approve on a failing test run.\n\n```bash\ngo test ./...\n```\n\nIf tests are slow, at minimum run tests for changed packages:\n\n```bash\n# Identify changed packages\ngit diff main..HEAD --name-only | rg '\\.go$' | sd '/[^/]+\\.go$' '' | sort -u\n\n# Run them\ngo test ./path/to/changed/... ./other/changed/...\n```\n\n## Self-Fix Protocol\n\nNot everything requires kicking back to the coder. Use judgment:\n\n### Fix it yourself (commit directly)\n\n- Typos in strings, comments, doc comments\n- Missing or incorrect doc comment on an exported symbol\n- Obvious import cleanup (unused import, wrong order)\n- Trivial one-liner corrections (off-by-one in a constant, wrong format verb)\n- Spell check fixes: `typos --write-changes`\n\nWhen self-fixing, commit with `fix: <description> (reviewer self-fix)` before signaling.\n\n### Kick to coder\n\n- Any logic error or incorrect algorithm\n- Missing tests or tests that don't cover the stated case\n- Architectural concerns (wrong abstraction, wrong package boundary)\n- Debugging work (flaky test, subtle race condition, unclear root cause)\n- Anything requiring more than ~10 lines of new code\n\nWhen kicking to coder, write a `review-changes` signal (see Signal Format). Be specific —\nthe coder should not have to guess what you want.\n\n## All Tiers Are Blocking\n\nEvery finding must be resolved before approval. There is no \"approved with comments.\"\n\n| Severity | Definition | Examples |\n|----------|-----------|---------|\n| **Critical** | Correctness, security, or data integrity at risk | panic in production path, data race, wrong algorithm, missing error check on DB write |\n| **Important** | Quality or maintainability significantly degraded | missing tests for new logic, copy-paste logic across 3+ sites, exported function without doc |\n| **Minor** | Small issues that accumulate into tech debt | typo in comment, inconsistent naming in a single file, magic number without const |\n\nAll three tiers must reach zero before you write a `review-approved` signal.\n\n### Round Tracking\n\nEach review cycle is one round. Track rounds explicitly in your signal output.\n\n- **Round 1** — initial review of the branch\n- **Round 2** — re-review after coder addressed Round 1 feedback\n- **Round N** — subsequent re-reviews\n\nRe-review only the items from the previous round plus any regressions introduced by fixes.\nDo not re-litigate closed items.\n\n## Verification Before Approval\n\nBefore writing `review-approved`:\n\n1. `go test ./...` passes with zero failures\n2. `typos` finds no spelling errors in changed files\n3. All checklist items resolved\n4. All previous round findings confirmed fixed (cite file:line)\n5. No new issues introduced by fixes\n\n```bash\n# Confirm test pass\ngo test ./... 2>&1\n\n# Confirm no typos in changed files\ngit diff main..HEAD --name-only | xargs typos\n```\n\n## Signal Format\n\n### Approved\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/plans/.signals\necho \"Approved. <one-sentence summary of what was reviewed and confirmed>\" \\\n  > docs/plans/.signals/reviewer-approved-<planfile>\n```\n\nExample:\n```bash\necho \"Approved. all 4 tasks complete, tests pass, no issues found.\" \\\n  > docs/plans/.signals/reviewer-approved-2026-02-27-feature.md\n```\n\n### Changes Needed\n\nWrite a structured heredoc signal. Include the round number, all findings grouped by severity,\nand file:line citations for every item.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p docs/plans/.signals\ncat > docs/plans/.signals/reviewer-requested-changes-<planfile> << 'EOF'\nRound N — changes required.\n\n## critical\n\n- `path/to/file.go:42` — <description of issue and what correct behavior should be>\n\n## important\n\n- `path/to/file.go:88` — <description>\n- `other/file.go:15-23` — <description>\n\n## minor\n\n- `path/to/file.go:100` — <description>\n\n## self-fixed\n\n- typo in `path/to/file.go:77` — fixed directly (committed)\n\nitems in \"self-fixed\" are already resolved. only items in critical/important/minor require\ncoder action.\nEOF\n```\n\nIf there are no findings in a tier, omit that tier header entirely.\n\n### Mode-Specific Behavior\n\n**Managed mode** (`KASMOS_MANAGED=1`):\nWrite the signal file and stop. Do not merge, push, or create PRs.\nkasmos reads the sentinel and handles the next step (spawning another coder wave or\npresenting merge options to the user).\n\n```bash\n# After writing signal:\nexit 0  # stop here\n```\n\n**Manual mode** (unset):\nWrite the signal file, then additionally offer the following options to the user:\n\n- If approved: offer to merge to main, create a PR, keep the branch, or discard it\n- If changes needed: offer to switch back to the coder role, or handle the fixes yourself\n\nPresent options concisely, wait for user input before taking any action.\n\nBase directory for this skill: file:///home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/kasmos-reviewer\nRelative paths in this skill (e.g., scripts/, reference/) are relative to this base directory.\nNote: file list is sampled.\n\n<skill_files>\n\n</skill_files>\n</skill_content>",

These tools understand syntax, structure, and context — producing safer, faster, and more accurate results than regex-based alternatives.\n\n<HARD-GATE>\n## Banned Tools\n\nThese legacy tools are NEVER permitted. Using them is a violation, not a preference.\n\n| Banned | Replacement | No Exceptions |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|\n| `grep` | `rg` (ripgrep) | Even for simple one-liners. `rg` is faster, respects .gitignore, and handles encoding correctly |\n| `grep -r` | `rg` | Recursive grep is still grep. Always `rg` |\n| `grep -E` | `rg` | Extended regex is still grep. `rg` supports the same patterns |\n| `sed` | `sd` | Even for one-liners. `sd` has saner syntax and no delimiter escaping |\n| `awk` | `yq`/`jq` (structured) or `sd` (text) | No awk for any purpose |\n| `find` | `fd` or glob tools | Even for simple file listing. `fd` respects .gitignore; use `fd -e go` for extension |\n| `diff` (standalone) | `difft` | `git diff` is fine — standalone `diff` is not |\n| `wc -l` | `scc` | Even for single files |\n\n**`git diff` is allowed** — it's a git subcommand, not standalone `diff`.

There are no exceptions. \"Just this once\" is a violation.\n</HARD-GATE>\n\n## Tool Selection by Task\n\nPick the right tool for the job. When multiple tools could work, the table shows the preferred choice and why.\n\n| Task | Use | Not | Why |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Rename symbol across files | `ast-grep` | `sed`/`sd` | AST-aware, won't rename inside strings/comments |\n| Structural code rewrite | `comby` | `sed`/`awk` | Understands balanced delimiters, nesting |\n| Find code pattern | `ast-grep --pattern` | `grep`/`rg` | Matches syntax, not text |\n| Find literal string | `rg` | `grep` | Fast, respects .gitignore, correct encoding |\n| Find files by name/extension | `fd` | `find` | Respects .gitignore, simpler syntax |\n| Replace string in files | `sd` | `sed` | No delimiter escaping, sane defaults |\n| Read/modify YAML/TOML/JSON | `yq` / `jq` | `sed`/`awk` | Understands structure, preserves formatting |\n| Review code changes | `difft` | `diff` | Syntax-aware, ignores formatting noise |\n| Spell check code | `typos` | manual | Understands camelCase, identifiers |\n| Count lines / codebase metrics | `scc` | `wc -l`/`cloc` | Fast, includes complexity estimates |\n| Multi-line structural rewrite | `comby` | `sed` | Handles cross-line patterns with holes |\n| Add/change function params | `comby` | manual | `func F(:[params])` patterns |\n| Simple literal find-replace | `sd` | `sed` | Simpler syntax, in-place by default |\n\n## ast-grep vs comby Decision\n\nBoth do structural code operations. Choose based on the transformation:\n\n| Scenario | Winner | Reason |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| Rename all calls to a function | ast-grep | AST-level symbol matching |\n| Find all usages of a pattern | ast-grep | Tree-sitter precision |\n| Add/change function parameters | comby | Hole syntax `:[params]` is natural |\n| Replace entire function body | comby | `{:[_]}` discards balanced block |\n| Insert code after a function | comby | Match + append in rewrite |\n| Add to import block | comby | `import (:[imports])` pattern |\n| Multi-line structural rewrite | comby | Balanced delimiter matching |\n| Lint-style pattern detection | ast-grep | Rule-based scanning |\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### rg (ripgrep)\n\nFast text search that respects .gitignore. Primary replacement for all `grep` variants.\n\n```bash\nrg 'pattern' [path]                            # basic search (recursive by default)\nrg 'pattern' --type go                         # filter by language type\nrg 'pattern' -g '*.go'                         # filter by glob\nrg 'pattern' -g '*.go' -g '!*_test.go'         # include/exclude globs\nrg -i 'pattern'                                # case insensitive\nrg -F 'literal[0]'                             # fixed string (no regex)\nrg -U 'start\\n.*end'                           # multiline match\nrg -l 'pattern'                                # list matching files only\nrg -c 'pattern'                                # count matches per file\nrg --no-heading -n 'pattern'                   # machine-readable output (file:line:match)\n```\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/rg.md](resources/rg.md)\n\n### ast-grep (`ast-grep`)\n\nAST-based code search and replace using tree-sitter. Matches syntax structure, not text.\n\n```bash\nast-grep run --pattern 'fmt.Errorf($$$)' --lang go          # find all calls\nast-grep run --pattern 'errors.New($A)' --rewrite 'fmt.Errorf($A)' --lang go  # replace\nast-grep run --pattern '$A != nil' --lang go src/            # search specific path\n```\n\nKey patterns: `$VAR` (single node), `$$$` (variable-length args), `$_` (wildcard)\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/ast-grep.md](resources/ast-grep.md)\n\n### comby (`comby`)\n\nStructural search/replace that understands balanced delimiters, strings, and comments. Superior to regex for multi-line code transformations.\n\n```bash\ncomby 'func :[name](:[args]) {:[body]}' 'func :[name](:[args]) error {:[body]}' .go -in-place\ncomby 'import (:[imports])' 'import (:[imports]\n\t\"new/package\"\n)' file.go -in-place\n```\n\n**Critical rule:** Always use `{:[body]}` (inline braces), never split `{` and `}` on separate lines.\n\nKey holes: `:[var]` (everything), `:[[var]]` (word), `:[_]` (unnamed wildcard), `:[var\\n]` (to newline)\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/comby.md](resources/comby.md) — read this before any non-trivial comby usage. Contains critical pitfalls around whitespace normalization and balanced delimiter matching.\n\n### difftastic (`difft`)\n\nSyntax-aware structural diff. Dramatically cleaner output for refactors and moves.\n\n```bash\ndifft old.go new.go                              # compare files\nGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git diff                  # git integration\nGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=difft git log -p -- path/file   # file history\ndifft --display inline old.go new.go              # single-column output\n```\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/difftastic.md](resources/difftastic.md)\n\n### sd (`sd`)\n\nModern sed alternative. In-place by default, no delimiter escaping needed.\n\n```bash\nsd 'old_name' 'new_name' src/**/*.go              # replace in files\nsd 'version = \"(\\d+)\"' 'version = \"2\"' file.toml  # regex with groups\nsd -p 'foo' 'bar' file.txt                         # preview (dry run)\nsd -F 'literal[0]' 'replacement' file.txt          # fixed string mode\n```\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/sd.md](resources/sd.md)\n\n### yq (`yq`)\n\nYAML/JSON processor (jq wrapper for YAML). Query and modify structured config files.\n\n```bash\nyq '.metadata.name' file.yaml                     # read field\nyq -y '.key = \"value\"' file.yaml                   # modify YAML\nyq -y '.dependencies += {\"new\": \"^1.0\"}' pkg.yaml  # add to map\ncat file.yaml | yq '.items[].name'                 # query array\n```\n\nNote: This is the Python-based `yq` (kislyuk/yq), a jq wrapper. Uses jq filter syntax. Use `-y` flag for YAML output, otherwise outputs JSON.\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/yq.md](resources/yq.md)\n\n### typos (`typos`)\n\nFast source code spell checker. Understands identifiers, camelCase, filenames.\n\n```bash\ntypos                          # check entire project\ntypos src/                     # check specific path\ntypos --write-changes          # auto-fix typos\ntypos --format brief           # compact output\n```\n\nRun before commits to catch typos in identifiers, strings, and comments.\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/typos.md](resources/typos.md)\n\n### scc (`scc`)\n\nFast code counter with complexity estimates. Useful for project scope assessment.\n\n```bash\nscc                                  # full project summary\nscc internal/                        # specific directory\nscc --by-file --sort lines           # per-file breakdown\nscc --not-match '_test.go$'          # exclude test files\nscc --include-ext go,ts              # specific languages only\n```\n\n**In-depth reference:** [resources/scc.md](resources/scc.md)\n\n## Violations\n\nThese violations are not suggestions. If you do any of these, you are violating the skill.\n\n| Violation | Required Fix |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Using `grep` for anything | Use `rg` for text search, `ast-grep` for code patterns |\n| Using `grep -r` (recursive) | Use `rg` — recursive by default, also respects .gitignore |\n| Using `grep -E` (extended regex) | Use `rg` — supports full regex including extended patterns |\n| Using `sed` for anything | Use `sd` for replacements, `ast-grep`/`comby` for refactoring |\n| Using `awk` for anything | Use `yq`/`jq` for structured data, `sd` for text processing |\n| Using `find` for anything | Use `fd` for file finding, glob tools for path patterns |\n| Using standalone `diff` | Use `difft` for syntax-aware structural diffs |\n| Using `wc -l` for counting | Use `scc` for language-aware counts + complexity |\n| Splitting `{` / `}` in comby templates | Always inline: `{:[body]}` not `{\\n:[body]\\n}` |\n| Forgetting `-in-place` with comby | Without it, comby only previews changes |\n\nBase directory for this skill: file:///home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools\nRelative paths in this skill (e.g., scripts/, reference/) are relative to this base directory.\nNote: file list is sampled.\n\n<skill_files>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/yq.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/typos.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/sd.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/scc.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/difftastic.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/comby.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/ast-grep.md</file>\n<file>/home/kas/dev/kasmos/.opencode/skills/cli-tools/resources/rg.md</file>\n</skill_files>\n</skill_content>",

It classifies a finished plan as \"dead\" if it has **any** instances, regardless of whether those instances are running. But plans with running instances should NOT be in the dead section — they should be in the active plans section.\n\nLet me also check what the screenshot shows more carefully. Looking at the screenshot:\n- `plan-review` has instances with colored dots (running/review status)\n- `reliable-planner-completion` has instances with check marks and colored dots\n- `quit-confirmation-dialog` has instances with colored dots\n\nThese are all in the \"dead\" section. The plans are `StatusDone` in plan-state.json, but they still have running instances (likely reviewers or coders that haven't been cleaned up).\n\nThe fix should be: in `splitDeadFromHistory`, if a finished plan has **running** instances, it should NOT go to dead — it should go back into the active plans list. Or alternatively, the dead section should be split into two: plans with running instances shown in an \"active\" section above dead.\n\nLet me look at how the test file handles this:",

          "text": "Now I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me trace through the logic:\n\n1. In `updateSidebarPlans()` (app_state.go:674), plans with `StatusDone` are filtered out of the active/ungrouped lists and put into `history`\n2. `splitDeadFromHistory()` then puts any history plan that has instances into `deadPlans`\n3. In `rebuildRows()`, `deadPlans` are rendered in the \"dead\" section\n4. The active plans section only contains plans from `n.plans` (which excludes `StatusDone` plans)\n\n**The problem**: A plan can be `StatusDone` but still have **running** instances (e.g., a reviewer is still active). These plans get classified as \"dead\" because they're `StatusDone` with instances, but they should be shown in an \"active\" section since they have running agents.\n\nThe fix should modify `splitDeadFromHistory` to check whether the plan has running instances. If it does, it should be treated differently — either moved back to the active plans list, or the dead section should be split so running-instance plans appear above truly dead ones.\n\nLooking at the screenshot again, the plans `plan-review`, `reliable-planner-completion`, and `quit-confirmation-dialog` all have colored status dots indicating running/review status. They should appear in an active section above the dead section.\n\nLet me check how `rebuildRows` structures the sections to understand the best fix:",

          "text": "Now I have the full picture. Here's the bug analysis:\n\n**Root Cause**: In `splitDeadFromHistory` (line 176-194), the function partitions finished (done) plans into \"dead\" vs \"history\" based solely on whether they have instances. It does NOT check whether those instances are **running**. A plan that is `StatusDone` but has running instances (e.g., a reviewer still active) gets put into `deadPlans` and rendered in the \"dead\" section.\n\n**Expected Behavior**: Plans with running instances should appear in an \"active\" section above dead, not inside the dead section. The `rebuildRows` function already has the concept of active plans (sort key 0,1) vs idle (sort key 2), but dead plans are emitted separately before that logic and never participate in the active/idle split.\n\n**The Fix**: `splitDeadFromHistory` should create a three-way partition:\n1. **Active dead plans** — done plans with running instances → should be emitted in the active section (or a new section above dead)\n2. **Dead plans** — done plans with only stopped/dead instances or manually inspected\n3. **History plans** — done plans with no instances\n\nAlternatively, the simpler fix: in `splitDeadFromHistory`, if a finished plan has running instances, add it back to `n.plans` instead of `n.deadPlans`, so it participates in the normal active/idle sort.\n\nLet me check if there's a `HasRunning` check available at the `splitDeadFromHistory` level:",

          "text": "Now I have the complete picture. Let me summarize the findings:\n\n---\n\n## Bug Analysis: Running instances shown in \"dead\" section\n\n### Root Cause\n\n**File**: `ui/navigation_panel.go`, function `splitDeadFromHistory` (lines 176-194)\n\nThe function partitions finished (`StatusDone`) plans into two buckets:\n- **dead**: has any instances OR was manually inspected\n- **history**: no instances\n\nThe problem is it uses a simple boolean (`instancesByPlan[p.Filename]`) — it only checks whether the plan has *any* instances, not whether those instances are **running** vs **stopped/ready**.\n\nA plan that is `StatusDone` in plan-state.json but still has running instances (e.g., a reviewer session still active, or a coder that hasn't been cleaned up) gets classified as \"dead\" and rendered in the dead section.\n\n### What the screenshot shows\n\nPlans `plan-review`, `reliable-planner-completion`, and `quit-confirmation-dialog` all have instances with running/review status indicators (green/red dots), yet they're all in the \"dead\" section. They should be in an active section above dead.\n\n### The flow\n\n1. `updateSidebarPlans()` in `app_state.go:674` filters `StatusDone` plans out of the active lists and puts them into `history`\n2. `splitDeadFromHistory()` puts any history plan with instances into `deadPlans`\n3. `rebuildRows()` emits `deadPlans` in the \"dead\" section (lines 289-298)\n4. The active/idle split (lines 300-309) only operates on `n.plans`, which **excludes** done plans entirely\n\n### Fix\n\n`splitDeadFromHistory` needs a three-way partition. Plans with running instances should not go to dead — they should either:\n\n**Option A** (minimal change): Add a new field like `n.activeDeadPlans` for done plans with running instances, and emit them in `rebuildRows` as a separate section above dead (or inline with the active plans section).\n\n**Option B** (simpler): In `splitDeadFromHistory`, check if the plan has running instances. If so, add it back to `n.plans` so it participates in the normal active/idle sort. This way done plans with running agents appear in the active section naturally.\n\n**Option C** (cleanest): Split the dead section rendering in `rebuildRows` — before emitting the \"dead\" toggle, separate `deadPlans` into those with running instances (emit them in the active section) and those without (keep in dead).\n\nI'd recommend **Option B** — it's the simplest and leverages the existing active/idle sort logic. The change would be in `splitDeadFromHistory`:\n\n```go\nfunc (n *NavigationPanel) splitDeadFromHistory(finished []PlanDisplay) {\n    // Track which plans have instances and whether any are running\n    type planInstanceInfo struct {\n        hasInstances bool\n        hasRunning   bool\n    }\n    infoByPlan := make(map[string]planInstanceInfo, len(n.instances))\n    for _, inst := range n.instances {\n        if inst.PlanFile != \"\" {\n            info := infoByPlan[inst.PlanFile]\n            info.hasInstances = true\n            if inst.Status == session.Running || inst.Status == session.Loading {\n                info.hasRunning = true\n            }\n            infoByPlan[inst.PlanFile] = info\n        }\n    }\n    n.deadPlans = nil\n    n.historyPlans = nil\n    for _, p := range finished {\n        info := infoByPlan[p.Filename]\n        if info.hasRunning {\n            // Running instances → promote to active plans list\n            n.plans = append(n.plans, p)\n        } else if info.hasInstances || n.inspectedPlans[p.Filename] {\n            n.deadPlans = append(n.deadPlans, p)\n        } else {\n            n.historyPlans = append(n.historyPlans, p)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe existing test `TestRebuildRows_DeadSection_DonePlanWithInstances` (line 127) would need updating since it creates a done plan with a **running** instance and expects it in dead — that's exactly the bug being codified in the test. The test should be updated to expect the plan in the active section instead.\n\nWant me to implement this fix?",
