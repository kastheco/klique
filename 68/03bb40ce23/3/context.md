### Prompt 1

Implement implement-a-custom-kas-verify-tiered-review-process-for. Goal: implement a custom /kas.verify tiered review process for PRs (evaluate using codex code review or some other github integration to use specific skills/review process we need to research it). this should trigger for new prs (not drafts) and kasmos should monitor the state of it somewhere non-invasive like a status bar (maybe bottom left or right?).

### Prompt 2

dont implement this, take the contents of it and merge it with the description of review-use-kas-verify then mark this plan cancelled
