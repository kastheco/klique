the logo animation and call to action don't show on startup anymore. it drops me into the info tab of a random plan

---

it's in ansi shadow block art

---

i'd prefer to keep info the default but show the logo until they navigate in teh sidebar

---

why am i getting notifications for focus-wave-W1-T1 finishing when you stop working?

---

commit both separately and push a new version v1.1.4
